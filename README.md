Project done while following the AISL Course at CNAM (http://goo.gl/gIlXeB) 

Programmed in PHP without any framework.

I wanted to try my hand in programming a CRM where :
  - all the information(logins, pws, clients intel...) is stored in a DB
  - navigation is made possible with the extensive use of forms
  - I can try POST et GET methods
  - I can start get XP in Object Oriented Programming
  - I can start to learn how to manage my code followind the MVC principles
  
This project is open-source : you can use it as you wish as long as it stays free & open-source.
